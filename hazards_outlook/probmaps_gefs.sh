#
# VERSION AND LAST UPDATE:
#   v1.0  06/09/2023
#   v1.1  01/04/2024
#
# PURPOSE:
#  Script to generate Probability Maps (Global Hazard Outlooks) of significant
#   wave height (Hs) and 10-m wind speed (U10) for week-2 forecast based on
#   NOAA GEFSv12 wave ensemble forecast.
#  This shell script cheks forecast files exist, and runs the python script
#   probmaps_gefs.py reading the path where it is located in the configuration
#   file probmaps_gefs.yaml
#
# USAGE:
#  This code expects the GEFv12 files are downloaded (see download_GEFSwaves.sh),
#    the path where .grib2 files are located must be saved in the probmaps_gefs.yaml
#    file, variable gefspath
#  It reads probmaps_gefs.yaml, where the path+name of the python script
#   probmaps_gefs.py is located (users must edit variable pyscript).
#  The last configuration edit is the variable outpath in probmaps_gefs.yaml, which
#    is the location where the final plots will be saved. Once the .yaml
#    is configured, there is no need to change in the daily basis, unless
#    you want to modify the destination path or any other configuration.
#  Before running the python script, python must be loaded and activated. Please 
#    customize this part at the end (lines 102 and 103).
#
#  Example:
#    bash probmaps_gefs.sh /media/name/test/probmaps_gefs.yaml
#
# OUTPUT:
#  Figures containing the probability maps, saved in the directory
#    outpath informed in the probmaps_gefs.yaml file.
#
# DEPENDENCIES:
#  The python code probmaps_gefs.py contains the module dependencies.
#
# AUTHOR and DATE:
#  06/09/2023: Ricardo M. Campos, first version 
#  01/04/2024: Ricardo M. Campos, the download of GEFS was removed from here,
#    which is now download_GEFSwaves.sh
